# my-first-ML-project
My first machine learning project using the "Iris Flowers" database: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

So far:
  -created dataframe using iris.csv
  -described and graphed data
  -did a train_test_split to make X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test
  -created many models to evaluate
  -did 10-fold cross validation to find SVM as most accurate for data
  -used SVM to analyze data
  -print accuracy and confusion matrix
